    title = {{Sensitivity of an Ocean-Atmosphere Coupled Model to the Coupling Method : Study of Tropical Cyclone Erica}},
    author = {Lemari{\'e}, Florian and Patrick, Marchesiello and Debreu, Laurent and Blayo, Eric},
    abstract = {{In this paper, the sensitivity of Atmospheric and
                  Oceanic Coupled Models (AOCMs) to the associated
                  coupling method is investigated. We propose the
                  adaptation of a Schwarz- like domain decomposition
                  method to AOCMs. We show that this kind of iterative
                  process ensures a good consistency of the coupled
                  solution across the air-sea interface, while usual
                  ad-hoc algorithmic approaches do not properly
                  satisfy this requirement. Indeed, those ad- hoc
                  methods correspond to only one iteration of a
                  Schwarz-like iterative method, without reaching a
                  converged state. Until now, it was assumed that this
                  lack of consistency does not affect significantly
                  the physical properties of the solution. The
                  relevancy of this statement is assessed in the
                  context of a coupling between a mesoscale
                  atmospheric model (WRF) and a regional oceanic model
                  (ROMS) in a realistic configuration aiming at
                  simulating the genesis and propagation of tropical
                  cyclone Erica. Sensitivity tests to the coupling
                  method are carried out in an ensemblist approach. We
                  show that with a mathematically consistent coupling
                  the spread of the ensemble is reduced thus
                  suggesting that there is room for further
                  improvements in the formulation of AOCMs at a
                  mathematical and numerical level.}},
